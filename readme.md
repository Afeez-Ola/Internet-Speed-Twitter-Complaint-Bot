Internet Speed Testing and Tweeting Project
===========================================

This Python project allows you to automate internet speed testing and tweet the results to your internet service provider (ISP). It utilizes the Selenium library to interact with websites and perform tasks programmatically, providing a convenient way to monitor and report your internet speed performance.

Features
--------

-   Automates internet speed testing using the Speedtest.net website.
-   Retrieves the actual download and upload speeds.
-   Tweets the speed test results to your ISP's Twitter account.
-   Includes a Chrome WebDriver for seamless browsing automation.
